# zio-bdd

**zio-bdd** is a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) testing framework built for Scala 3 and ZIO. This framework enables developers to write expressive, type-safe, and concurrent tests using Gherkin syntax, integrated seamlessly with ZIO's powerful effect system.

## Overview

`zio-bdd` bridges the gap between human-readable specifications and executable tests. It supports Gherkin feature files, type-safe step definitions, scenario-scoped state management with `ScenarioContext`, and integration with ZIO services seamlessly. Whether you're new to BDD or an experienced ZIO user, this documentation will guide you through every aspect of using `zio-bdd` effectively.
